The Starter Course fundamentals source code for Ultimate AngularJS [Starter course](https://courses.toddmotto.com).

### Running these projects

Some of these may require a local server, however most do not. All you need to do is run a local server, if you're on OSX you can run a python command from the command line:

```
cd <ultimate-angular-starter-seed>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

If you're on Windows, you can also download and run python, or if it's easier you can setup a local server by using your favourite IDE.
